						This subdomain is for a text-based adventure game project.
					</p>
					<p>
						I played a lot of <a href="https://homestarrunner.com/dungeonman" target="_blank">dungeonman</a> on Homestar Runner when I was a kid; I was very bad at it, but I liked the idea enough that once I learned what binary trees were in high school computer science, I immediately implemented a simple text-game with them.
					</p>
					<p>
						It was really simple, but watching my friends stumble their way through a nonsensical zombie-apocalypse scenario in which they were frequently characters was beyond fun. I even made a UI to show images based on the game-state.
					</p>
					<p>
						I've tried a couple times since to make a more sophistocated verison of that game, but I never completed one and I'm not sure where the code is anymore.
					</p>
					<p>
						So this is that; yet another attempt that I hope I'll be able to stick with!

								Re-launched! This time I've structured the project directory so that the text adventure can more easily share common code with the main website.
