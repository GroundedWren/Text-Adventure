					<p>
						This subdomain is for a text-based adventure game project.
					</p>
					<p>
						I played a lot of <a href="https://homestarrunner.com/dungeonman" target="_blank">dungeonman</a> on Homestar Runner when I was a kid; I was very bad at it, but I liked the idea enough that once I learned what binary trees were in high school computer science, I immediately implemented a simple text-game with them.
					</p>
					<p>
						It was really simple, but watching my friends stumble their way through a nonsensical zombie-apocalypse scenario in which they were frequently characters was beyond fun. I even made a UI to show images based on the game-state.
					</p>
					<p>
						I've tried a couple times since to make a more sophistocated verison of that game, but I never completed one and I'm not sure where the code is anymore.
					</p>
					<p>
						So this is that; yet another attempt that I hope I'll be able to stick with!

								I hereby declare the Dungeon Builder finished! Now just to implement the game....
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="card">
							<h3 class="card-header"><time datetime="2023-11-17T06:00:00.000Z">11/17/23</time></h3>

								More generic components and saving! We still have a long way to go, though.

								The Dunegon Builder is beginning to come along - basic UI is mocked up and some skeleton functionality exists. Also, I added a theme switcher.
							</p>

								New page- Dungeon Builder! On a long international flight I mapped out what the structure of the game world might be, and I've created this page to help create save files which conform to that format. It's still a WIP.'

							<h3 class="card-header"><time datetime="2023-07-21T05:00:00.000Z">7/21/23</time></h3>

								I've added more statistics to the character, still mostly borrowing from 5e but with a little Vera twist. I've also made it so loading/saving from a file works.

								Mostly just a face-lift. I'm trying to make the dungeoneer interface console work well on mobile, but some of the issues can't be tested but on a real mobile device, so it's hard.

							<h3 class="card-header"><time datetime="2023-07-06T05:00:00.000Z">7/6/23</time></h3>

								Responsive layout! The Dungeoneer Interface now meets
								<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#reflow" target="_blank">WCAG 1.4.10</a> so that it works well on mobile :)

							<h3 class="card-header"><time datetime="2023-07-03T05:00:00.000Z">7/3/23</time></h3>

								Created the console framework to handle a configurable set of commands. Created the first part of a caracter builder.

								Re-launched! This time I've structured the project directory so that the text adventure can more easily share common code with the main website.
